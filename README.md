# RIFT

The demo code for our IEEE TIP paper:
Li, Jiayuan, Qingwu Hu, and Mingyao Ai. "RIFT: Multi-modal image matching based on radiation-variation insensitive feature transform." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 29 (2020): 3296-3310.

RIFT is designed for multimodal image feature matching. It is suitable for optical-optical, infrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical, depth-optical, map-optical, and day-night matching.
