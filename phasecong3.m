% PHASECONG3 - Computes edge and corner phase congruency in an image.
%
% This function calculates the PC_2 measure of phase congruency.  
% This function supersedes PHASECONG2 and PHASECONG being faster and requires
% less memory
%
% There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
%
%   [M m or ft pc EO, T] = phasecong3(im, nscale, norient, minWaveLength, ...
%                           mult, sigmaOnf, k, cutOff, g, noiseMethod)
%
% However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
% usage can be as simple as:
%
%    M = phasecong3(im);
% 
% Arguments:
%              Default values      Description
%
%    nscale           4    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
%    norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
%    minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
%                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
%                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
%    k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
%                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
%                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
%                            20 for noisy images 
%    cutOff           0.5  - The fractional measure of frequency spread
%                            below which phase congruency values get penalized.
%    g                10   - Controls the sharpness of the transition in
%                            the sigmoid function used to weight phase
%                            congruency for frequency spread.                        
%    noiseMethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
%                            noise statistics. 
%                              -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
%                              -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
%                               0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold 
%
% Returned values:
%    M          - Maximum moment of phase congruency covariance.
%                 This is used as a indicator of edge strength.
%    m          - Minimum moment of phase congruency covariance.
%                 This is used as a indicator of corner strength.
%    or         - Orientation image in integer degrees 0-180,
%                 positive anticlockwise.
%                 0 corresponds to a vertical edge, 90 is horizontal.
%    ft         - Local weighted mean phase angle at every point in the
%                 image.  A value of pi/2 corresponds to a bright line, 0
%                 corresponds to a step and -pi/2 is a dark line.
%    pc         - Cell array of phase congruency images (values between 0 and 1)   
%                 for each orientation
%    EO         - A 2D cell array of complex valued convolution result
%    T          - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
%                 diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
%                 this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
%                 computation time.
%
%   EO{s,o} = convolution result for scale s and orientation o.  The real part
%   is the result of convolving with the even symmetric filter, the imaginary
%   part is the result from convolution with the odd symmetric filter.
%
%   Hence:
%       abs(EO{s,o}) returns the magnitude of the convolution over the
%       image at scale s and orientation o.
%       angle(EO{s,o}) returns the phase angles.
%   
% Notes on specifying parameters:  
%
% The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong3(im, 5, 6, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 2.0, 0.4, 10);
%
% or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong3(im, 5, 6, 3);
%
% or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
% keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong3(im, 5, 6, 3, 'cutOff', 0.3, 'k', 2.5);
% 
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
% specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
% to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
% experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation factor.
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
% sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)

% RAYLEIGHMODE
%
% Computes mode of a vector/matrix of data that is assumed to come from a
% Rayleigh distribution.
%
% Usage:  rmode = rayleighmode(data, nbins)
%
% Arguments:  data  - data assumed to come from a Rayleigh distribution
%             nbins - Optional number of bins to use when forming histogram
%                     of the data to determine the mode.
%
% Mode is computed by forming a histogram of the data over 50 bins and then
% finding the maximum value in the histogram.  Mean and standard deviation
% can then be calculated from the mode as they are related by fixed
% constants.
%
% mean = mode * sqrt(pi/2)
% std dev = mode * sqrt((4-pi)/2)
%
